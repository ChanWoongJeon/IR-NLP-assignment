5,"During the last two decades many developing countries have joined the global tourism market as part of globalization processes and the fall of the Iron Curtain. These countries had suffered from negative public and media image which made it challenging for them to compete over tourists with countries with strong and familiar brands. In this global era, a problematic image is a major obstacle in attracting tourists, high-quality residents and investors. However, in the case of destinations suffering from prolonged image crises, it seems almost unrealistic to expect any target audience to visit a destination and “put aside” these long-lasting negative images and stereotypes, just because of an advertising campaign or other promotional effort. Tackling prolonged negative place images is crucial for developing tourism in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Although these destinations differ greatly, in the eyes of many potential tourists they all suffer from weak place images, negative stereotypes and problematic perceptions.",growing conflicts between tourists and local people,roles of media in shaping the global trend in tourism,necessity of global cooperation for sustainable tourism,importance of the tourism industry in national economy,developing nations’ need to improve destination images
5,"In the last few years cartography has been slipping from the control of the powerful elites that have exercised dominance over it for several hundred years. You probably already have noticed this with the emergence of fantastically popular mapping applications such as Google Earth. The elites — the map experts, the great map houses of the West, national and local governments, the major mapping and GIS companies, and to a lesser extent academics — have been confronted by important developments that threaten to undermine their dominance. For example, as Google Earth has shown, the actual business of mapmaking, of collecting spatial data and mapping it out, is passing out of the hands of the experts. The ability to make a map, even a stunning interactive 3D map, is now available to anyone with a home computer and a broadband Internet connection.",various ways of collecting geographic data,various technologies involved in map-making ,roles of maps in developing human civilizations ,regained popularity of paper maps in the digital era ,diminishing dominance of cartographic elites and its cause
2,"If we look out of a window in winter, we might see millions of identical snowflakes fluttering by. However, if we took a magnifying glass and looked at the flakes separately, we would soon discover that they were not identical — in fact, that each flake had a distinct shape that no other flake duplicated exactly. The same is true of human beings. We can tell quite a lot about what Susan will experience just by the fact that she is human. We can tell even more by knowing she is an American girl, living in a certain specific community, with parents of such and such an occupation. However, after everything is said and done, knowing all the external parameters will not allow us to predict what Susan’s life will be like. Not only because random chance might throw all bets off, but more importantly, because Susan has a mind of her own with which she can either decide to waste her opportunities, or conversely overcome some of the disadvantages of her birth.",danger of evaluating things through appearance,what makes it difficult to predict a human’s life,how to discover the beauty of natural elements,effects of external conditions on one’s personality,necessity of observation for understanding objects
2,"The regional and local press faces its own distinct problems over the faith they can place in websites to compensate for the loss in sales and advertising revenues. With property and car classified advertising moving to websites run by the estate agents, car dealers and various aggregators ― although some regional publishers are trying to compete with their own sites in these areas ― website advertising revenues are hard to come by. And will the former or current readers of local news in local papers visit the local website? Great efforts are being made, with local papers seeking to offer the stories which once proved so popular with their newspaper readers, the very local, community news. One successful example here is Gazettelive.co.uk, the site run by the Middlesbrough Gazette.

3,"Some city planning experts called for legislation against texting while walking that would be followed by a deep change of norms. This recommendation is based on the assumption that this change is welcomed, but laws banning texting while walking failed in Toronto, Arkansas, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey and New York. Meanwhile, high-tech firms are developing technological solutions to the problem, offering a transparent screen that allows pedestrians to see what is going on in front of them while texting. Another direction for adaptation to the problem was provided by city councils via better urban planning and interventions to generate awareness. Some towns and college campuses have put ‘look up’ signs in dangerous stairwells and intersections.

5,"Creating a workplace environment that positions employees to do their best work is clearly worthwhile. But it’s not the only way of using workplace design to benefit organizations. Organizations can use their space to communicate their message to the outside world. Cornell University management professor Franklin Becker compares a company’s use of office space to its “organizational body language.” When a person says one thing and their body communicates another, listeners are left confused. The same can be said for organizations that claim a particular characteristic but fail to follow through in their interior design. They come across as inauthentic to their employees, whose impressions inevitably trickle down to clients. The more a company’s message is reinforced in a workplace environment, the easier it is for employees to integrate that vision and relay it to the people they meet. This is why so many top organizations are now investing in designing interiors that are culturally distinctive and deliver a consistent message — one that the company wants to communicate with the outside world.",advantages of small organizations over large ones,how to achieve efficient communication among employees,ways to utilize an organization’s human resources effectively,necessity of a company’s customer communication channel ,importance of integrating company vision in workplace design
4,"Before television, an entertainer had to work his or her way up from the bottom, working local circuits and vacation resorts before eventually landing a spot in the big vaudeville revues. By the time the top was reached, the act was practiced and refined, and the entertainer was a veteran of the circuit. With television, all that changed. Now a green performer, thrust onto television in the Ed Sullivan Show or the Amateur Hour , could suddenly capture the attention of the nation in one brief moment. Careers could now be launched with one good appearance, where the performer would command a larger audience than a lifetime of vaudeville circuits could ever provide. The sudden rise and decline of stars became commonplace. Some, like Elvis Presley, would rise and stay at the top. Others, like Julias La Rosa, a young Brooklyn singer who rocketed to fame on Arthur Godfrey and His Friends , burned brightly and briefly before fading into obscurity.

4,"Let’s say that one of your coworkers is a particularly negative individual who is always complaining about others. In doing your situation monitoring work, you notice that being around this coworker brings down your mood. Can you think of ways to avoid ― or at least reduce the amount of time you spend with ― this person? Or if going to a fast food restaurant and overeating makes you feel more depressed, then work on reducing this type of behavior. If you notice that watching too much television or getting into arguments with your spouse/partner is associated with a negative mood, then reductions in both types of behavior may be the key to improving this mood. Sometimes you can’t resolve a depressing situation or completely avoid a person who gets you down, but you can look for ways to reduce the negative impact on your emotional state.",danger of labeling colleagues as negative,impact of working environment on job satisfaction,misconceptions about good relationships with people,necessity of reducing exposure to depressive situations,importance of keeping a balance between work and play
4,"Those who educate others about art and who employ art criticism methodologies are aware of specific approaches which emphasize focal points that should be noted in a work of art. Karen Hamblen has worked with students and museum patrons of all ages and varying cultural groups, engaging them in art criticism, and feels very strongly that many formats for this process need to be acknowledged, developed, and utilized which will present diverse perspectives. If the art critic is properly a servant, of the public and the artist, both, then he or she should choose varying ways of serving that public in order to best communicate and make the unseeable visible in a language that is understood by the public. As art critics are also models and teachers for those who are learning to engage themselves in criticism, they should look to express themselves in varying ways.

5,"Developing countries created a bargaining issue linkage between forests and other issues and in so doing they raised the price of forest conservation. There was a clear power-based dimension to the negotiations. In terms of possession of economic power, the developed countries possess more capabilities than the developing countries on all important indicators, such as share of global GDP, GDP per capita, and influence in international economic and financial institutions. The developing countries have a history of staking a claim to the finance and technology of their developed counterparts, but prior to the advent of international environmental issues they had little they could bargain with in return.

1,"We humans have a self-important view of our place in the world. “Evolutionists have been preoccupied with the history of animal life in the last 500 million years,” Lynn Margulis, one of the great evolutionary biologists of our time, once wrote. She championed a different perspective; she was a defender of the microscopic beings that make all other life possible. Bacteria were the only life on Earth for about half the planet’s history. In a sense, they remain dominant even today, thriving in just about any habitat, from glacial ice to hot springs. The total mass of the world’s bacteria is probably greater than that of all other life combined. Human bodies are prime bacterial real estate. Our intestines carry several pounds of bacteria.

5,"Among white immigrants, Italians were often singled out and initially criticized for their use of expensive imported ingredients and fondness for garlic, which was considered too pungent by those used to blander cooking styles. However, these culinary prejudices were relatively short lived. Within decades of their arrival to the United States in large numbers, the Italian American cuisine they had created became one of the nation’s most popular. Not only did Italian American-owned restaurants soon become destinations for special occasions, but beginning in the 1920s, many Americans from other backgrounds began to experiment with making Italian American-inspired food in their own homes.

5,"The term “biological control” has been used, at times, in a broad context to cover a full spectrum of biological organisms and biologically based products. This has been spectacularly successful in many instances, with a number of pest problems permanently resolved by importation and successful establishment of natural enemies. These importation successes have been limited largely to certain types of ecosystems and/or pest situations such as introduced pests in perennial ecosystems. On the other hand, this approach has met with limited success for major pests of row crops or other ephemeral systems. In these situations, the problem is often not the lack of effective natural enemies but management practices and a lack of concerted research on factors that determine the success or failure of importation attempts in the specific agro-ecosystem setting. Thus, importation programs, to date, are largely a matter of trial and error based on experience of the individual specialists involved.

3,"When scientists write a paper, they metaphorically have a product to promote. The product is their set of ideas about why certain phenomena exist. Occasionally, it is the only product on the market, and they need only to convince the consumer to buy any product at all. Whether or not scientists are successful will depend in part on how persuasive they are and in part on how much the product is needed. No advertising campaign is likely to sell flowers that are guaranteed not to germinate or an explanation of why people don’t normally stand on their heads rather than their feet. In most cases, however, there is an already established demand for the product. Because competing salespersons are trying to corner the market, scientists must persuade the consumer not just to buy any product but rather to buy their product.",recent changes in scientific research subjects,importance of feedback in scientific publishing,necessity of scientific papers being persuasive,roles of scientists in industrial decision-making,impact of scientific discovery on product development
5,"When the prices of assets we invest in cannot be explained by normal means, then we should call that situation a bubble. But do not get this wrong. The fact that bitcoin’s price has been on an almost exponential rise does not make it a bubble, especially since it is not a stock in a company but a store of value in and of itself. There is no horrible earnings report or increased supply to pile it up, and demand seems to be steadily increasing as bitcoin becomes more mainstream. Since bitcoin is divisible into other very small units such as satoshis, and these units will always be able to buy, for example, $100 worth of bitcoin, there is no point where it becomes too expensive for the average person, and thus it can serve as a stable method of transaction. An asset price might be so complex that fundamental means cannot be used to explain the disparities; however, that does not make such a price shift a bubble. In a similar sense, a 30% drop doesn’t mean the bubble has burst, because it has happened dozens if not hundreds of times in bitcoin’s history and it has always surpassed the previous high again shortly after.",limitations of bitcoins as an asset, effects of economic bubbles on bitcoins , ways to increase the demand for bitcoins,importance of bitcoins in overcoming the recession ,reasons not to consider bitcoin price shifts a bubble
2,"The most common settlement form is nuclear . Most rural people live in houses clustered in a village with forest and grassland lying beyond. The settlement land use protects most households from any insect-transmitted diseases from woods and fields. The nuclear form, however, facilitates the fecal contamination of water sources and the spread of directly contagious diseases. Houses in a dispersed settlement form are located on farmland, and neither air nor water provides much focus of contagion for the scattered population. Each household, however, is exposed to vectored diseases originating in the natural surroundings. A linear settlement, in which houses are lined up along both sides of a river, canal, or road, has an intermediary position and often is characterized by the worst conditions of the other two settlement forms. People are only partially protected from insect-transmitted diseases because the rear of the dwelling is exposed; yet the clustering of houses provides a focus for contagion.

2,"One of the ways that dogs can interpret whether human word sounds are directed at them is through our body language. Obviously, if I’m looking directly into the dog’s eyes and have his full attention, then there is no ambiguity about the words “Come,” “Sit,” or “Down.” Under such conditions, the dog knows that these are commands that are clearly directed at him and he should know that you are expecting him to respond to those words. In the absence of that sort of explicit body language, however, the dog’s name becomes the key to his understanding. In effect, a dog’s name becomes a signal which tells him that the next sounds that come out of his master’s mouth are supposed to have some impact on his life.

3,"Normally, the formation of a neutron star occurs at the end point of a massive star’s life, in which a great deal of mass is compressed by gravity into a very small volume. As a result, individual protons and electrons in the original material fuse at high temperature to form neutrons. Since there are no protons in a neutron star, there is no need for a strong nuclear force to hold the nucleus together against the enormous electromagnetic force that is due to repulsion of positively charged protons in the nucleus. (By nature, protons repel each other because like charges repel while unlike charges attract.) Nor is there any need for a strong nuclear force to hold the proton that is attracted to the electron outside the nucleus. Therefore, the strong nuclear force that usually holds protons together with the nucleus is expressed directly as the gravitational force of a neutron star, which results in a very heavy mass and strong gravitational field in spite of its very small size. In fact, a typical neutron star is only about 10-20 kilometers in diameter, but it has a mass of about 1.4 times that of the Sun in our solar system.",various roles of protons in a neutron star,effects of a neutron star on its solar system ,reasons of a neutron star having a heavy mass,ways to reduce the gravitational force of a neutron star,difficulties of protecting neutron stars from nuclear forces
3,"Since the late 1970s the supply of qualified students seeking doctoral education in the sciences and engineering has tended to be less than the number of places potentially available for them. Market forces, in other words, have favored the applicants, with evident consequences. One effect has been a substantial increase in the number of international students. Universities have thus enlarged and improved the supply of qualified applicants by substituting highly qualified international students for lower-ranked (or nonexistent) domestic ones. The number of doctorates granted to foreign nationals tripled from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, exceeding 50 percent of graduates in engineering and 30 percent in the natural sciences. A second development has been the gradual improvement of the support packages given to doctoral students.

5,"The human consequences of natural events were considered beyond control until about three centuries ago. People’s behaviors were thought to leave all but their immediate environs undisturbed. People lived in subsistence, self-contained communities granting them few options but to adapt to the whims of local natures. Many people were ill-fated and had to endure famine, flood, and pestilence. They did little about what nature did to them. The intellectual challenges to nature of the 18th century offered a more expansive, less fatalistic vision. As was always acknowledged, nature could affect the social order for good or for ill. The contrasting Enlightenment notion that the social order could affect nature for good or for ill took about two centuries to spread over the intellectual landscape. Nature and the social order are now frequently viewed as jointly determined, implying that people can manipulate nature as an asset to do less ill and more good for them",absolute influences of nature on social order,difficulties in adapting to the whims of nature ,limitations of the Enlightenment notion of nature ,human efforts to utilize nature throughout history ,changes in the perspectives on nature and humans
5,"It is well known that people in a corporate environment gain a lot more by working on their soft skills than their hard skills. Learning how to communicate with people, making quick decisions, being a leader and knowing how to manage others in a friendly way are much more effective ways of climbing the ladder than working on hard, technical skills. In itself, this is not a problem, as having good people skills has tremendous benefits in the long term. Conversely, this suggests why those who tend to climb the corporate ladder are likely to be more of a salesman type than a technically knowledgeable problem solver. This, in turn, explains why, over time, these employees tend to become mediocre workers who are not as bright as the more technically skilled workers at the bottom of the ladder.",growing importance of developing hard skills,qualification for becoming a good problem solver,difficulties of climbing the ladder of success at work,why soft skills are more difficult to learn than hard skills,merits and demerits of developing soft skills in a corporation
2,"For many regions of the world, climate is the main impetus for attracting visitors and, in this way, forms an important part of the region’s natural resource base for tourism. Clearly, therefore, any change in climate will affect the natural resources. The problem is that comparatively little is known, other than in very general terms, about the relative contribution of climate to this resource base: especially, the particular role climate plays and its effects on tourism. Even less is known about the economic impacts of climate or climate change on commercial prospects for tourism. There has been some progress in assessing which climate-related criteria people use to make decisions related to tourism, but it is true to say that in the published research on tourism and climate in general, the nature of the relationship between the two is usually based on assumptions rather than empirical data.

3,"In the early 1990s, David Spiegel, a psychiatrist at Stanford University, studied women with breast cancer. This study showed that psychiatric interventions such as group therapy and training in coping strategies prolonged life when used in conjunction with cancer drug therapies. While leading a social support group for women with breast cancer, Spiegel found that during the months of group therapy, the women formed deep emotional bonds with one another. With Spiegel’s and his staff’s guidance, they learned to express their emotions ― their sadness and their anger at having cancer. Many eventually achieved a sort of peace ― an acceptance that their cancer was a part of them and yet separate from them. Outside the groups, if times were tough, the women called each other for social support. The ways that women in these groups lent their support included the same ways we use to signal any social interaction through all of the senses ― a tone of voice, a touch, and a sympathetic glance.

1,"1950s critics separated themselves from the masses by rejecting the ‘natural’ enjoyment afforded by products of mass culture through judgments based on a refined sense of realism. For example, in most critics championing Douglas Sirk’s films’ social critique, self-reflexivity, and, in particular, distancing effects, there is still a refusal of the ‘vulgar’ enjoyments suspected of soap operas. This refusal again functions to divorce the critic from an image of a mindless, pleasure-seeking crowd he or she has actually manufactured in order to definitively secure the righteous logic of ‘good’ taste. It also pushes negative notions of female taste and subjectivity. Critiques of mass culture seem always to bring to mind a disrespectful image of the feminine to represent the depths of the corruption of the people. The process of taste-making operated, then, to create hierarchical differences between the aesthete and the masses through the construction of aesthetic positions contrary to the perceived tasteless pleasures of the crowd.

2,"Gossip has negative connotations in the Nordic countries and hardly a good name in the Anglo-Saxon world. Yet, according to Professor Robin Dunbar of University College London, who has studied the human ability to gossip for a long time, gossip proves far more important to us than we would at first admit. While some animals obviously communicate well in small groups, it is hardly likely that they can gossip about third parties. This ability to talk about third parties enables us to form large social or working groups of up to approximately 150 members. This number holds true for ancient “clans,” military fighting units (a company), and even modern firms. Once a commercial enterprise swells well beyond that magic number, it has to be organized into divisions or it becomes less manageable. Intense interest in what other people are doing, finding out from our “group” the latest news about third parties, enables us to network on a large scale and calculate our positions and reactions accordingly.",importance of gossip in making public opinion,role of gossip in the formation of large groups ,historical changes in people’s perception of gossip ,influence of gossip on the evolution of human affection,necessity of restricting inappropriate gossip in a group
5,"Because every slice of social life potentially offers an unlimited amount of evidence, social researchers must be selective in their use of evidence. It would take an infinitely long research report to use all the evidence a typical case offers. Although researchers usually collect large volumes of evidence, the quantity they collect can, at best, constitute only a tiny fraction of the evidence they potentially could collect. They try to focus on only the most significant portions, using their ideas, analytic frames, interests, past studies, and so on to help them assess what seems most important to their research questions. The problem of selecting evidence returns them to their ideas and analytic frames. They perceive evidence and select some of it as especially relevant because of their ideas and frames.

3,"Considering the multitude of ways people benefit from insects, it is curious that insects continue to suffer from such an unfavorable reputation. Ironically, while many of us perceive insects as harmful pests ― dangerous, ugly, and disease-ridden ― in reality, without the service of pollination which they provide humankind might cease to exist. The promotion of negative stereotypes of insects can be largely traced to failure by Europeans to appreciate or understand the customs of the lands they colonized and their misperception that the way of life of most indigenous populations they encountered was barbaric. Many people’s dislike for insects stems from a similar classist attitude that associates insects with indigenous people who lack the means to buy or grow alternate sources of food. Again this prejudice stems largely from Western cultures. In contrast, cultures of many Eastern nations such as Japan and China consider various species of insects to be great delicacies.

5,"Many of us labor under a self-limiting myth that contributes to our “invisibility” ― the “myth of craftsmanship,” the idea that good work speaks for itself. Organization survivors know that, in fact, good work speaks for itself only if you give it a voice. Recent years have seen the rise of what has been called the “entrepreneurial economy”: “championing” a product, an idea, or a career, and giving it a powerful voice. In any contact-dependent endeavor, success requires both effective performance and effective self-promotion ― making your competence and your ability to contribute visible. If you can’t do that, you will be passed over for promotion during succession planning time, or when the company is determining which individuals to keep during layoffs.

3,"The establishment of cultivated fields gave an opportunity to numerous unwanted plants to invade the newly-made habitats and to evolve as weeds. Weed evolution went hand in hand with crop cultivation, and from the very start, the control of these invaders seems to have been a major problem in agriculture. Noxious weeds are plants that have successfully adapted themselves to the ecology of the cultivated ground. They are independent only because they retain their wild mode of seed dispersal and germinate and develop in spite of the efforts of the cultivator to remove them. But if any such weeds turn out to produce a valuable commodity, they can eventually change their relationship with humans. The cultivator may start to utilize the weeds by intentionally planting their seeds, harvesting their fruits, and selecting the better yielders.

4,"Custom becomes second nature, and this is especially true of meals. We expect to eat them at a certain time and place, and we have a set of foods considered appropriate for each. Bacon, eggs, and toast are breakfast; sandwiches are lunch; meat, potatoes, and vegetables are dinner, followed by dessert. Breakfast for dinner is so much fun precisely because it is out of the ordinary and transgressive. But meal patterns were not always this way. In the Middle Ages people ate two meals, the larger in the morning. Today the idea of a heavy meal with meat and wine at 11:00 a.m. strikes us as strange and decidedly unpleasant. Likewise, when abroad, the food that people eat, at what seems to us the wrong time of day, can be shocking.

1,"Mainstream schools are trying to find ways to work with slow, disruptive and disaffected students without undermining the education of the other children in the schools, a requirement that most schools are finding a major challenge. Emotional literacy, the capacity to understand and manage one’s emotions, has been shown to be one of the tools that can help make the inclusion of ‘difficult’ children easier. For example, Southampton City Local Education Authority in the UK set a target of no exclusions for its schools. Since making emotional literacy what they term ‘the heart of the process’ their exclusions have reduced steadily year on year. In the USA two projects which taught ‘difficult’ students the emotional skills that help them to fit into classrooms more easily and control their own behaviour, while emotionally supporting their classmates to tolerate their behaviour more easily and positively, were shown to be very effective in helping the difficult students stay in the classroom without undermining the learning of other students.

5,"The printing press boosted the power of ideas to copy themselves. Prior to low-cost printing, ideas could and did spread by word of mouth. While this was tremendously powerful, it limited the complexity of the ideas that could be propagated to those that a single person could remember. It also added a certain amount of guaranteed error. The spread of ideas by word of mouth was equivalent to a game of telephone on a global scale. The advent of literacy and the creation of handwritten scrolls and, eventually, handwritten books strengthened the ability of large and complex ideas to spread with high fidelity. But the incredible amount of time required to copy a scroll or book by hand limited the speed with which information could spread this way. A well-trained monk could transcribe around four pages of text per day. A printing press could copy information thousands of times faster, allowing knowledge to spread far more quickly, with full fidelity, than ever before.

4,"We argue that the ethical principles of justice provide an essential foundation for policies to protect unborn generations and the poorest countries from climate change. Related issues arise in connection with current and persistently inadequate aid for these nations, in the face of growing threats to agriculture and water supply, and the rules of international trade that mainly benefit rich countries. Increasing aid for the world’s poorest peoples can be an essential part of effective mitigation. With 20 percent of carbon emissions from (mostly tropical) deforestation, carbon credits for forest preservation would combine aid to poorer countries with one of the most cost-effective forms of abatement. Perhaps the most cost-effective but politically complicated policy reform would be the removal of several hundred billions of dollars of direct annual subsidies from the two biggest recipients in the OECD ― destructive industrial agriculture and fossil fuels. Even a small amount of this money would accelerate the already rapid rate of technical progress and investment in renewable energy in many areas, as well as encourage the essential switch to conservation agriculture.

3,"With the general accessibility of photocopiers in student libraries, students tend to copy the relevant material for later use. In such cases the students are not always selective about what they copy. Often useless material is gathered that may seem important at the time but does not seem so in their study room on the night before an exam or essay due date. In addition, when most people photocopy material from books, they feel as if they have actually accomplished something. After all, a few photocopied pages in their notebook now represent information that used to be in a big, thick book. The reality of the situation is that nothing significant has been accomplished yet. The student only has the information in a transportable form. He or she has not learned anything from the material.

2,"As an evolutionary biologist, I am often asked whether humans are still evolving today. We certainly are. But the answer to the question of how we are changing is far more complicated. Our data suggests that the classic natural selection scenario, in which a single beneficial mutation spreads like wildfire through a population, has actually occurred relatively rarely in humans in the past 60,000 years. Rather, this mechanism of evolutionary change usually seems to require consistent environmental pressures over tens of thousands of years. Already this finding is helping to refine our understanding not only of recent human evolution but also of what our collective future might hold. For a number of the challenges currently facing our species — global climate change and many infectious diseases, for example — natural selection probably occurs too slowly to help us much.

3,"Every large bookstore has a shelf filled with books designed to help you get more money. The books say that greater wealth often provides more happiness. New research shows that the law of diminishing marginal utility also applies to money. In a national sample of Americans, individuals thought that their satisfaction with life would double if they made $50,000 rather than $25,000: twice as much money, twice as much happy. But the data revealed that people who earned $50,000 were only 9 percent more satisfied than those making $25,000. Around the world, income has surprisingly little influence on whether people smile, laugh, and experience enjoyment on a typical day! And in the United States, once people are earning around $75,000 per year, making more money has no impact at all on their day-to-day feelings of happiness.","The More Money, the More Desire",Money: The Biggest Cause of Stress,Does More Money Mean More Happiness?, Money and Happiness: Which Is More Important?,Happiness Depends on How Much You Accomplish
1,"A comparison of two very different activities illustrates what GDP is: a rise in crime leading to a rise in the prison population; and more people deciding to take short holiday breaks in luxury hotels. It costs roughly the same to keep someone in a high security prison as it does to stay at a top-flight hotel. Building a new prison or a new hotel appears as economic activity and so adds to GDP. Each extra night spent in either also increases GDP. In that sense both are a form of economic growth; but one decreases welfare, while the other increases it. This flaw is equally well illustrated by the divorce rate in a country. If it rises there will be additional activity for the lawyers ― that shows up as an increase in GDP. But the standard of living in the country has not risen as a result of the rise in the number of divorces; indeed it has fallen. A country may appear richer if its GDP rises, but the crude measurement of wealth of GDP per head makes no allowance for the way the GDP is generated.",GDP: A Real Indicator of Welfare?,Remove Crime-Generated Income from GDP!,Why Rich Countries Have Lower Divorce Rates?,Should We Pursue Money at the Cost of Welfare? ,Welfare vs. Security: Rivaling Investment Priorities

This is the idea that struggling with a mental puzzle ― trying to remember a phone number or deciding what to do on a long Sunday afternoon ― inoculates you against future mental hardships just as vaccinations inoculate you against illness. There is good evidence to support the idea that small doses of mental hardship are good for us. Young adults do much better on tricky mental puzzles when they’ve solved difficult rather than easy ones earlier. Adolescent athletes also thrive on challenges: we’ve found, for example, that college basketball teams do better when their preseason schedules are more demanding. These mild initial struggles are critical.

Is there really an advantage to performing toward the end of a competition? Researcher Wändi Bruine De Bruin’s latest paper, published in the journal Acta Psychologica , describes her studies on European figure-skating competitions and the Eurovision Song Contest, a pop song competition that has taken place in Europe since 1956 (and which, like American Idol , includes voting by fans watching at home). She found that participants appearing near the end of the contests received higher marks from judges than those who performed earlier. This phenomenon is known as the serial position effect . Bruine De Bruin also found that the effect was progressive, with scores increasing throughout the competitions, not just when judges evaluated all candidates at the end of each contest, but also when they were asked to rate each individual performance after it had been completed.",Competition: Survival of the Fittest,Candidates Who Perform Last Finish First ,Every Participant Is a Winner in His Contest,Brilliant Performances Don’t Come Overnight,"In Competition You Win or Lose, There Is No Grey"

Straying from proven ways is rarely a creative act in such cases; rather, it is a sign of poor training, lack of attention, incompetence, or stupidity. For example, the captain of Aeroflot Flight 593 who broke the rules by giving his children a flying lesson in midflight was stupid, not creative. He first let his daughter fly the plane, then he gave his son a chance. Unfortunately, this 15-year-old boy made an error with the yoke, the plane stalled, and went into a dive that his dad could not reverse. When people are flying an airplane, there are enormous advantages to following proven methods. Safety is one of them!

As my team and I were brainstorming the plan, we’d make sure everybody in the campaign had a piece of the creative pie. It built unity and it was also strategic, because when a message needs to change, conflict can erupt between those who created the message and those who did not. The ones who created it are more likely to cling to the message and feel threatened by change. They may even be worried about losing their jobs. The ones who didn’t contribute to the message may be tempted to point fingers or use the situation to gain leverage. But if everyone contributed to the original plan, there’s a sense that “We’re all in this together; no single one of us is to blame.” Everyone will also feel more enthusiastic about creating and promoting an evolved message.

5,"When you watch bees single-mindedly labor to make honey, it’s hard to believe that their greatest role in nature is something they are entirely unaware of: distributing pollen. Pollen is, in effect, the male part of a plant; it transfers DNA to the female part of the flower, an essential step in reproduction. Plants can disperse pollen by wind or insects, usually bees. As a honeybee hunts for nectar in flowers, pollen grains stick to its hairy body. When it visits more flowers, some of the pollen drops off, fertilizing the plant. Plants that rely on wind emit vast clouds of pollen, hoping a few grains will drift into other flowers. From an evolutionary point of view, harnessing insects is so much more efficient that insect-pollinated plants typically make one-thousandth as much pollen as their wind-dependent cousins.",Urban Beekeeping Harming Wild Bees,Pollen Grains: Male Germ Cells in Plants,"Definition, Types, and Methods of Pollination",Wind: An Efficient Way Plants Disperse Seeds,Honeybees: A Flower’s Important Agent of Pollination
2,"Many environmentalists use the phrase “Think globally, act locally.” That means you should be active in your community with the purposes of being planet-friendly. But it is also important to think globally and eat locally. A typical meal in the United States travels about 22,000 miles to reach your plate. The fish, meat, fruits, vegetables, and spices are often trucked and flown back and forth around the world as they are produced, packaged, and finally sold. That amounts to lots of “food miles,” and the travel along with the manufacture and disposal of the packaging burns fuel and causes pollution. That’s why some people call themselves “locavores” ― people who won’t eat anything that has been grown or prepared more than 100 miles away. When you buy food at nearby farmers’ markets, you are contributing both to cleaner air and to your community’s well-being.

2,"Although play is universal among children, there are differences in the kinds of play observed across cultures. Families in various cultures encourage different types of play and attach different meanings to play activities. For instance, differences were apparent in a study that compared how Japanese and American mothers interacted with their young children in a free-play situation. Japanese mothers encouraged their young children to engage in pretend play ― suggesting, for example, that the child kiss a doll or offer the doll some food. American mothers emphasized the functional uses of the toys ― “Push the bus” ― and spoke more about the toys as objects than did Japanese mothers. Japanese mothers viewed the play situation as an opportunity to teach their children how to interact with others, whereas American mothers used play to teach their children about the world and how to explore it on their own.

They are the product of inspired patience, of skilled hands and an inquiring but unbiased mind. Moreover, they speak for themselves, or at least they speak too powerfully and too insistently for prejudiced humans to silence them. It would be wrong to suppose that such beliefs are not sincerely held, yet almost nobody thinks they can provide a basis for action in public contexts. Any scientist who announces a so-called discovery at a press conference without first permitting expert reviewers to examine his or her claims is automatically castigated as a publicity seeker.

2,"When our feathers are ruffled because something is said or done that challenges our values, we sometimes react as if it were an emergency. We take immediate action to resolve our differences without giving the situation or how it could be handled any serious thought. The consequences of our reaction also aren’t fully considered; we can only think about our next move and how it will prove our point or improve our position. In these circumstances, it is best that we do not react right away. We can slow down and allow ourselves adequate time to respond in accordance with our values and goals. When we feel compelled to react, we can instead pause to observe and fully experience the emotions associated with those reactions so that we can make informed decisions.

As the slumber recedes into the night, we awake to become who we are. The morning haze of dreams and oblivion disperses and lifts as recognition and recall bubble up the content of our memories into our consciousness. For the briefest of moments, we are not sure where we are and then suddenly “I,” the one that is aware, awakens. We gather our thoughts so that the “I” who is conscious becomes the “me” ― the person with a past. The memories of the previous day return. The plans for the immediate future are reformulated.

Television coverage provides only one of many possible sets of images and narratives related to an event, and there are many images and messages that audiences do not receive. If we went to an event in person, we would see something quite different from the images selected and presented on television, and we would develop our own descriptions and interpretations, which would be very different from those carefully presented by media commentators.

If, like most people, you are right-handed, the control of language is probably concentrated more in your left hemisphere. By contrast, if you are among the 10% of people who are left-handed, it is much more likely that the language centers of your brain are located more in the right hemisphere.

Right up until the moment of failure the dinosaur was a success. But hindsight satisfaction with success was no protection against extinction in the future. Furthermore, right up to the end the various parts of the dinosaur were carrying out their evolved function in perfect order: the heart, the brain, the muscles and sinews were all performing as competently as ever.

1,"In moderate winds, leaves bend back and flutter. As the wind’s force increases, leaves change their behavior and absorb a portion of the wind’s strength, using it to furl into a defensive posture. The leaves fold onto themselves, rolling their margins to the center. They take on shapes of strange fish, shedding air from their aerodynamic surfaces. The compound leaves of hickories fold each leaflet to the central stalk, forming a loosely rolled cigar. Air rushes past, its death grip loosened. As the wind weakens, the leaves spring back, unrolling into sails again. Lao Tzu reminds us: “Grass and trees are pliant and fragile when living, but dried and shriveled when dead.

In large part, the difference between the martial artist’s slow-motion world and that of boredom narrows down to a matter of perceived control. The martial artist controls the speed of events. He or she slows down the external world in order to take charge of what would otherwise be too complex to take on. The resulting sense of competence is exhilarating. In Zen, the extreme slowing of time is a complete sense of timelessness ― literally, nirvana. In the case of boredom, the slowing down of the clock feels outside of one’s control. The boredom controls the individual’s sense of time. Affectively, this slowing down is experienced at the very least as unpleasant; often it is extremely painful. At the pathological extreme of boredom lies a sense of hopelessness.

Environmentalists argue that no system of waste disposal can be absolutely safe, either now or in the future. Governments and the nuclear industry have tried to find acceptable solutions. But in countries where popular opinion is taken into consideration, no mutually acceptable solution has been found. As a result, most spent fuel has been stored in the nuclear power plants where it was produced. This is now causing its own problems as storage ponds designed to store a few years’ waste become filled or overflowing. One avenue that has been explored is the reprocessing of spent fuel to remove the active ingredients. Some of the recovered material can be recycled as fuel. The remainder must be stored safely until it has become inactive. But reprocessing has proved expensive and can exacerbate the problem of disposal rather than assisting it.

Backformation is a process by which a word is formed by omitting what appears to be a morpheme but which in reality is not. For example, edit is a backformation from editor , and scavenge is backformed from scavenger . Both editor and scavenger came into English from other languages: editor from Latin editus and scavenger from Old French scawager . Note the /n/ that was inserted from the French word to the English word; this by analogy with other words like messenger (French, messager ) and passenger (French, passager ). Although each of these words ends in er , this er is not equivalent to the er affix that means “one who does X,” as with driver and teacher , where the er is affixed to the verbs drive and teach .

The first is infrequency of use by any one person. Products and businesses that have had a constant influx of new customers for this reason include funeral services, landscaping projects, pregnancy tests, real estate agencies, and moving companies. The second factor is durability. We use cars and refrigerators all the time, but because they typically last for many years, we buy them only once in a while. People who purchase such products, therefore, behave like new customers; unlike consumers of toothpaste and other disposable products, they’re not constantly in the market.

The conflict may arise due to differences between you and the other individual(s), or it could be an internal conflict, resulting from having to make decisions when confronted by culturally different beliefs or values. Encountering disagreements is a natural characteristic of interacting with individuals who have differing perceptions of what is right or wrong, good or bad, acceptable or unacceptable, etc. The important aspect is not whether conflicts will occur, because they will, but rather how to successfully manage the situation. Normally, the best resolution of an external conflict happening in intercultural communication is one where both parties are satisfied ― mutual agreement. This is often achieved through reciprocal compromise, as in international business and diplomatic negotiations.

1,"A defining element of catastrophes is the magnitude of their harmful consequences. To help societies prevent or reduce damage from catastrophes, a huge amount of effort and technological sophistication are often employed to assess and communicate the size and scope of potential or actual losses. This effort assumes that people can understand the resulting numbers and act on them appropriately. However, recent behavioral research casts doubt on this fundamental assumption. Many people do not understand large numbers. Indeed, large numbers have been found to lack meaning and to be underestimated in decisions unless they convey affect (feeling).
